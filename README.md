## Drinks

#### An application that shows a drinks menu.

This application allows users to input their age into a form. If the user is at least 21, they can view a menu with drinks. If they are under 21, they view a message with an apology and denial of service.

## Technologies Used

## Known Bugs

I plan to add more styling to this application when I have more time. I also would like to expand the drinks menu to include more choices.
